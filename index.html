    <h2>WHO AM I?</h2>

    <p>Edogawa Conan is an alias used by the teenage detective who took the appearance of a child after being exposed to a manufactured poison called the APTX4869, released by an evil crime syndicate. The poison reverted the age of his body whilst leaving his nervous system intact, which allowed him to retain his memories, personality, and intellect.</p>
    <br>The great detective uses these circumstances to solve mysteries in his town and further investigate the culprits behind his attempted murder.</br>
    <p><i>"There is always only one Truth!"</i> - Conan's one of many catchphrases</p>
